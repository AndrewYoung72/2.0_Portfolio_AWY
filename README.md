## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to improve upon our previous portfolio assignment. Now that we have completed project one we have something to add to our portfolios besides our regular homework assignments. The assignment also asked us to update our GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, as well as, our resume. This goes along with a milestone in the career conection I believe and is preparing our profiles and resume for future interviews in the type of position we may be seeking. 

## Description

My portfolio is pretty straight forward. At the top I have navagation links inside an image of the Rocky Mountains with a sticky postion that allows the page to scroll under the header. The links have a hover background with a box shadow and take the user to the selected section when clicked. In the work section I have displayed our team project along with two of my better assignments to date. Each picture has a title which links to the repository, a title which displays when the cursor hovers over the image, and a link inside the image which takes the user to the deployed page when the image is clicked. The resume section has a title which displays when the cursor is hovers over the image. And when the resume image is clicked the user is taken to a PDF whith a button to download my resume. Next is the contact section which displays my email address, link to ny GitHub repository, Linkedin profile, and Linktree account. The footer is sticky like the header and has a link that takes the user to the top of the page.
