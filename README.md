## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to improve upon our previous portfolio assignment. Now that we have completed project one we have something to add to our portfolios besides our regular homework assignments. The assignment also asked us to update our GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, as well as, our resume. This goes along with a milestone in the career conection I believe and is preparing our profiles and resume for future interviews in the type of position we may be seeking.
